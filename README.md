# Basic NixOS Configuration with Home Manager for WSL2 (Personal Setup)

This is my basic and bare-bones configuration for using **NixOS** and **Home Manager** on **WSL2**. Iâ€™m currently learning how to set up and manage NixOS, and this setup is minimal for now, with the goal of expanding and refining it as I progress.

### Resources:
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
- [NixOS on WSL](https://nix-community.github.io/NixOS-WSL/)
- [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)
- [NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/)
- [MyNixOS](https://mynixos.com/)
- [NixOS with Flakes](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/start-using-home-manager)

This configuration is just a starting point and will be updated as I learn and experiment more with NixOS and Home Manager.
